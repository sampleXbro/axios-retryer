# Known Issues

This document outlines known issues, unexpected behaviors, and edge cases discovered in axios-retryer through comprehensive integration testing.

## üî¥ Active Issues

### 1. Metrics Inconsistency
**Severity:** Medium  
**Component:** Core Metrics  
**Description:** Retry counts in metrics may not always match expected values across different scenarios.

```typescript
const metrics = retryer.getMetrics();
// Sometimes shows 1 retry when 2 were expected, or vice versa
expect(metrics.successfulRetries).toBe(2); // May fail intermittently
```

**Workaround:** Use `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual()` assertions instead of exact counts in tests.

**Impact:** Affects monitoring and debugging capabilities but not core retry functionality.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Unexpected Behaviors

### 1. POST Request Idempotency Requirement
**Severity:** Low (By Design)  
**Component:** Core Retry Logic  
**Description:** POST requests require an `Idempotency-Key` header to be retryable by default.

```typescript
// ‚ùå This POST won't be retried by default
await retryer.axiosInstance.post('/api/data', { data: 'test' });

// ‚úÖ This POST will be retried
await retryer.axiosInstance.post('/api/data', 
  { data: 'test' }, 
  { headers: { 'Idempotency-Key': 'unique-key-123' } }
);
```

**Rationale:** Safety measure to prevent duplicate operations on non-idempotent endpoints.

**Workaround:** 
- Add `Idempotency-Key` headers to POST requests
- Or configure custom retry strategy to allow POST retries without the header

## üîß Configuration Gotchas

### 1. Concurrent Request Limits
**Description:** Setting `maxConcurrentRequests` too low can cause unexpected queuing behavior.

```typescript
const retryer = createRetryer({
  maxConcurrentRequests: 1, // May cause significant delays
  queueDelay: 100
});
```

**Recommendation:** Use higher concurrency limits unless specifically testing queue behavior.

---

### 2. Circuit Breaker Reset Timing
**Description:** Circuit breaker `openTimeout` affects both failure detection and recovery timing.

```typescript
const circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreakerPlugin({
  failureThreshold: 3,
  openTimeout: 1000 // Affects both failure counting window and recovery time
});
```

**Note:** Consider this dual impact when setting timeout values.

---

## üß™ Test Environment Issues

### 1. Timing-Sensitive Test Flakiness
**Severity:** Low (Testing Only)  
**Component:** Test Suite  
**Description:** Tests involving delays or timeouts may be flaky in CI environments.

**Affected Areas:**
- Circuit breaker timeout tests
- Cache expiration tests
- Retry delay timing tests

**Workaround:** Use longer timeouts and `toBeGreaterThan()` assertions for timing-related tests.
