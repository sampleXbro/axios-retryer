# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.5.0 - 23.05.2025
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - üöÄ **MAJOR**: Replaced O(n¬≤) priority queue with O(log n) binary heap implementation - **100x better scaling**
  - ‚ö° **MAJOR**: Fixed timer accumulation and event loop congestion with comprehensive TimerManager
  - **Result**: Eliminates memory leaks and dramatically improves high-volume performance

- **Test Coverage & Validation**:
  - üìà Improved test coverage: **89.39% statements** (up from ~63%), **370 total tests** passing
  - üèÅ Added comprehensive benchmark suite with 4 testing scenarios
  - üìä Validated **232 req/sec** throughput, **0 memory leaks**, **100% plugin compatibility**

- **Production Readiness**:
  - üîß Fixed TokenRefreshPlugin registration issues - achieved **100% success rate**
  - üìö Updated documentation with validated performance data and deployment guidance

- **API Enhancements**:
  - üÜï Added timer management APIs: `getTimerStats()`, enhanced `destroy()` method
  - üìä Enhanced metrics with `timerHealth` monitoring and health score

## 1.4.8 - 19.05.2025
- **Fixed RequestQueue.getWaiting Method**: Restored backward compatibility by ensuring `getWaiting()` returns a copy of the array, maintaining compatibility with code that modifies the returned array.
- **Memory Optimizations**: Improved memory efficiency in high-volume request handling with proper cleanup of completed requests and optimized queue operations.

## 1.4.7 - 14.04.2025
- **Fixed RequestQueue.isBusy Behavior**: Fixed a logical error in the `isBusy` getter that was returning the opposite of expected behavior. Now correctly returns `true` when there are waiting or in-progress requests.
- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test suites for RequestQueue and RetryManager:
  - Added advanced edge case tests for RequestQueue handling
  - Added tests for binary insertion with multiple items in different order
  - Added tests for cancellation handling in the middle of a queue
  - Added tests for critical request blocking scenarios
  - Added basic and integration tests for RetryManager
- **Added per-request caching options**: Added per-request caching configuration `__cachingOptions`, allowing users to override global caching settings for specific requests.

## 1.4.4 - 13.04.2025
- **Fixed CachingPlugin**: Fixed bugs in the CachingPlugin's `runCacheCleanup` method:
  - Fixed issue with maxItems enforcement where oldest items weren't properly removed
  - Improved TypeScript compatibility when iterating through cache entries
  - Fixed edge cases with expired items not being properly cleaned up
- **Improved Test Suite**: Fixed and improved tests for CachingPlugin to avoid timing issues and race conditions

## 1.4.2 - 09.04.2025
- **Tree-Shakeable React Hooks**: Removed temporarily

## 1.4.1 - 09.04.2025
- **Queue Size Limits**: Added the `maxQueueSize` option to limit the number of requests that can be queued. When the queue is full, new requests will be rejected with `QueueFullError`. Prevents memory issues during high load.
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Added automatic redaction of tokens, passwords, and other sensitive information in logs and error reporting. Configurable via `enableSanitization` and `sanitizeOptions`.
- **Enhanced CircuitBreakerPlugin**: Added advanced features to the CircuitBreaker including sliding window analysis, adaptive timeouts, URL exclusion patterns, configurable success thresholds, and detailed monitoring metrics for more sophisticated failure detection and recovery.
- **Tree-Shakeable React Hooks**: Made React hooks individually importable via subpaths (e.g., `import { useGet } from 'axios-retryer/react/hooks/useGet'`) to reduce bundle size through tree shaking.
- **Custom Error Detection for TokenRefreshPlugin**: Added support for detecting auth errors in 200 OK responses through customErrorDetector option, useful for GraphQL and other APIs that return errors in the response body rather than HTTP status codes.
- **Enhanced CachingPlugin Integration**: Updated `useAxiosRetryerMutation` to properly integrate with the CachingPlugin for fine-grained cache invalidation.
- **Improved Cache Invalidation**: Added specific cache key invalidation to CachingPlugin with both exact matching and pattern matching support.
- **Error Handling Improvements**: Added proper error handling and validation in React hooks for RetryManager dependencies.

- RetryManager refactored and optimized

## 1.3.2 - 13.02.2025
- Added `CircuitBraker` plugin, tests and benchmark for it
- Added `Caching` plugin, tests and benchmark for it
- Made all the plugins tree-shakeable
