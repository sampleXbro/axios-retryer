- Expose an event (like onRequestCancelled) so any external UI or state management can track these cancellations
- Expose onMetricsUpdated hook
- Add per-request and global timeouts to avoid indefinitely hanging requests
- Add priorities for queued requests, allowing higher-priority requests to skip ahead
- Add log levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error) for better control over output verbosity
