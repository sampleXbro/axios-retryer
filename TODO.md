- Add per-request and global timeouts to avoid indefinitely hanging requests

1. Memory
1.1   Limit queue/store size.
1.2	  Redact or reduce large payloads in store/logging.
1.3	  Double-check no references remain after requests finish.

2. Security
2.1   Redact tokens or secrets in logs or persistent storage.
2.2   Resist DoS by bounding concurrency and store size.
2.3   Ensure plugin usage is from trusted sources (the plugin approach is powerful but must be used carefully).

3. Performance
3.1   Validate concurrency logic for race conditions.
3.2   Offer optional adaptive rate limiting or circuit-breaker patterns for repeated failures.

4. Developer Experience
4.1   Provide graceful shutdown and optional persistence for requests.
4.2   Possibly add more robust error messages or fallback strategies when store is full.
4.3   Offer integration with advanced telemetry (we could let users supply custom reporters).
